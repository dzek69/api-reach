# api-reach

JavaScript universal API Client that is easy, just-works and is feature rich/pluggable. Based on `fetch`.

## Features

- features list is @TODO but it's better than others 😎

## TODO

### Important

- add cache support

### Less important

- cookie jar support
- add files upload support
- add binary support
- handle multiple same header
- handle same header, different letters case
- if using url with query params and object query params - merge them
- add abort container wrapper, that will abort all requests in it (useful for stopping stuff for websites) [?]
- add a lot of tests
- audit for memory leaks or performance degrading (compared to bare fetch)

### Almost not important

- code cleanup (eliminate hardcoded values)
- allow injecting qs methods
- handle >= 600 statuses as unknown status
- do not pass unknown options to `fetch`
- handle unknown options (incorrect type)
